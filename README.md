So excited to present my first Kotlin project, inspired by the Android Studio tutorial. 
I've followed along another youtube tutorial previously but did not understand a single bit despite coming out with a funtioning app. 
In this attempt, I have gained a more concrete understanding of the **kotlin language**, **function logics**, and finally brave enough to add my own idea in it 

*_yay creativity_**

there are still improvements that could be made but in the meantime here is v1
